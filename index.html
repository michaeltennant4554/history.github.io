    <h4>Element: Developing historical consciousness</h4>
    <p>being historically conscious means that students acquire a distinctive way of seeing the world and their place in it from a historical perspective. 
    <br>They are aware of the impact of change, both short-term and long-term, on the human condition and in different spatial and temporal contexts.</br>
    <br>They also have a sense of historical empathy or regard for the motivations and actions of people in the past, in the context of their time.</br>
    <br>They can make judgements about the significance of events in the past, and appreciate the need to examine controversial or contested issues from more than one perspective.</br:
    <br>historically-conscious students are mindful of how their environment has been shaped by people and events in the past and bring this historical sensibility to bear in their appreciation of human achievement.<br>
    <br>concepts such as viewpoint and objectivity, and cause and consequence, are also considered in this strand element.</br>
